# Coding-Practice

Welcome to my Coding Practice repository! This is a collection of small scripts, experiments, and implementations that Iâ€™ve created while learning and exploring various concepts in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **NLP**, and **LLMs**.

##  Purpose
This repository serves as:

- A learning journal to document my progress and experiments.

- A reference for fundamental concepts and techniques.

- A showcase of my ability to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on topics. Each script includes a brief description and key takeaways.
